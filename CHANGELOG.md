- `dio_cron_batch_size`: Adjust Action Scheduler batch size (default: 25)
- `dio_cron_request_timeout`: Customize site request timeout (default: 5 seconds) 
- `dio_cron_request_args`: Modify HTTP request arguments per site

#### 🏗️ Dependencies & Requirements
- **Required**: `woocommerce/action-scheduler ^3.8`
- **Composer**: Automatic dependency management and autoloading
- **WordPress**: Multisite network with `manage_network_options` capability
- **PHP**: Object-oriented features (classes, namespaces, method chaining)

### 2.0.0

- Rename plugin to `DIO Cron`
- NOTE: this is a breaking change. 
  - The plugin will be deactivated after the update. You need to reactivate the plugin.
  - New endpoint: `/dio-cron`
  - Filters have been changed to `dio_cron_*`

### 1.0.12

- Refactor error message handling

### 1.0.11

- Maintenance update

### 1.0.10

- Added GitHub Actions output format when using ?ga parameter

### 1.0.9

- Add sites caching using transients to improve performance.

### 1.0.8

- Update documentation.

### 1.0.7

- Set the number of sites to 200. You can use the `add_filter( 'dss_cron_number_of_sites', function() { return 100; } );` to change the number of sites per request.

### 1.0.6

- Make plugin faster by using `$site->__get( 'siteurl' )` instead of `get_site_url( $site->blog_id )`. This prevents use of `switch_to_blog()` and `restore_current_blog()` functions. They are expensive and slow down the plugin.
- For `wp_remote_get`, set `blocking` to `false`. This will allow the request to be non-blocking and not wait for the response.
- For `wp_remote_get`, set `sslverify` to `false`. This will allow the request to be non-blocking and not wait for the response.
